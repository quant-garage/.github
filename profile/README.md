# Data Engineering Upgrades & Repair

## Data Engineering Upgrades & Repairs

Like any vehicle, when the engine is broken momentum stalls.
Repairs and upgrades will usually enable and facilitate optimal data workflows.
This promotes faster innovation and data product development. Helping others to achieve this seamless state of flow is our life's work.


We are two  programmers who do data science, open source programming,
and Linux systems administration out of a dream office located in a downtown Ottawa garage.
Mathematical modelling, econometrics, and statistics is our passion.
Python and Linux are our tools of choice, although there isn't much else we have not tried.
